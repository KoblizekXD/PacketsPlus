# Packets+
Packets+ is a utility library/mod aiming to provide events
for Minecraft's networking's packets, currently in early
state of development.  
For now I will be providing **only** client sided packet events, 
this will be fixed in future updates.  

### Installation  
There will be potentially 4 ways of downloading:  
- Custom Build - build the JAR yourself by cloning the repository  
- Prebuilt JAR - download from releases if there are any
- Modrinth - not yet available
- CurseForge - not yet available
